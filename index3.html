            <p>Sports, just as music is not just for performers, is not just for athletes. They belong to everyone, both the authorities and the bystanders.</p>
            <p>Life has to be active, life needs movement.</p>
            <p>So I chose to run. Running in the morning, you can also strengthen the body, can improve resistance! Sunshine, cloudless, in such a morning running, is the best, because it can feel how comfortable and happy. Besides, I found out. Running is a kind of enjoyment. When we went running in winter, the door opened and the wind blew bitterly, but when we came back from running, we were warm and comfortable.</p>
            <p>Love sports, friends. Sports not only belongs to the winners, sports not only belong to the competitors, sports more belong to all concerned about sports, love life, belong to each other as we are common.
